CodeWarrior Setup

This project was produced using CodeWarrior 7.0 for PalmOS on Win2000.
Note that the resource files are using the pirc plugin (which must be
configured for the build to work).  In addition, the Cygwin package is
required to run configuration and makefiles.

Building

First, run pippy/src/Palm/Modules/makesetup.  Then, configure any
desired frozen Python modules and run the Makefile in the "frozen"
subdirectory.  After this, building using CodeWarrior should run
successfully.

Frozen Module Configuration 

Additional frozen modules can be included in pippy.prc by adding them
to the imports of the basic default_modules.py file or to the
frozen/app.py file.  To run the resourcer, frozen/Makefile will need
to be modified (or the appropriate variable set on the command line of
make) to locate the desktop version of Python 1.5.2+.
