The distribution includes pre-built .prc files for the interactive
interpreter.  Simply install python.prc and pylib.prc on the Palm and
select the python application.

The interactive interface is a command-line interface based that
implemented in LispMe (http://www.lispme.de/).  It is very limited,
but provides a means for entering python commands and viewing the
results.  If you wish to contribute to improving this interface, see
the TODO list below.
