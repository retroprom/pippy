This document describes how to install the tools necessary for compiling Python
for the Palm. 

INSTALLATION

We used Redhat-6.2 for our development, but the toolset will generally
work for W95 and higher.  So,

either:

Obtain the tools (from ftp://ivan.Harhan.ORG/fs2/pub/embedded/palmos
prc-tools.0.6.0beta.tar.gz and prc-tools.0.6.0beta-fixes) and install.

or (for Linux only):

Download the file prc-tools-0.6.0-1.i386.rpm.  This file contains
prc-tools.0.6.0beta, the fixes and pilrc-2.6 and installs in
<prefix>=/usr/local/palm.  It has been tested using Redhat-6.2,
but may work with other releases.

Then:

*  Download the "Palm OS SDK 3.5 Headers and Libraries" from
http://www.palmos.com/dev/tech/tools.

*  Unpack the headers into <prefix>/com, such that the resulting path
to the directory "Core" is <prefix>/com/sdk/include/Core.

*  Copy libPalmOSGlue.a and libNetSocket.a into <prefix>/m68k-palmos-coff/lib.
See KNOWN PROBLEMS below for libNetSocket.a caveat.

Your toolset is ready for building Python on the Palm.

KNOWN PROBLEMS

The supplied libNetSocket.a supplied with the SDK has given me problems in the
past.  Download NetSocket.c from the Palm (found in the SDK for Windows
Platforms), recompile and create a new libNetSocket.a.

WHY THIS TOOLSET?

There are several toolsets available for developing applications for the Palm.
Palm supports prc-tools-2.0 (derived from prc-tools-0.5) and Code Warrior
(Windows only).  We chose prc-tools.0.6.0beta, a revision of prc-tools based on
prc-tools-0.5, for a variety of reasons.  It provides GLib shared libraries with
multiple-segment support, seamless access to globals within each segment and
function pointer support.  None of the other development toolsets currently
provide all of these features.
