This document describes how to install the tools necessary for 
compiling Python for the Palm.  


INSTALLATION

Either:

Obtain (from ftp://ivan.Harhan.ORG/fs2/pub/embedded/palmos
prc-tools.0.6.0beta.tar.gz and prc-tools.0.6.0beta-fixes) and install.

Or:

Download the file prc-tools-0.6.0-1.i386.rpm.  This file contains
prc-tools.0.6.0beta, the fixes and pilrc-2.6 and installs in
<prefix>=/usr/local/palm.  

Then:

*  Download the "Palm OS SDK 3.5 Headers and Libraries" from
http://www.palmos.com/dev/tech/tools.

*  Unpack the headers into <prefix>/com, such that the resulting path
to the directory "Core" is <prefix>/com/sdk/include/Core.

*  Copy libPalmOSGlue.a and libNetSocket.a into <prefix>/m68k-palmos-coff/lib.
See KNOWN PROBLEMS below for libNetSocket.a caveat.


KNOWN PROBLEMS

The supplied libNetSocket.a supplied with the SDK has given me problems in the
past.  Download NetSocket.c from the Palm (found in the SDK for Windows
Platforms), recompile and create a new libNetSocket.a.
